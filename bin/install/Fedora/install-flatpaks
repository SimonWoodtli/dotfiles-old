## Add Flathub Repo
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo

## Flatpaks are quite isolated from the rest of your OS, that makes it
## perfect package manager for things that are of privacy concern to
## install them like this.

## To get this to run on Fedora is quite annoying. On Debian it should be much easier
# 1. install this: https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules (andorid documentation mentions adding udev rules but there is only a deb package)
# 2. download and unzip the android SDK platform tools: https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling
# 3. Make sure your phone has developer options activated and enabe usb debugging and wifi debugging
# 4. run platform-tools/./adb devices => no permission error (attached device is what you need)
# 5. try this:(non permanent solution) sudo ./adb kill-server && sudo ./adb start-server (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14460656/android-debug-bridge-adb-device-no-permissions) 
# 6. Now with an actual USB cable debugging (./adb devices now asks my phone to allow usb debugging)works and GUISCRPY works via
# cable. However still need to find a way to make it work with wifi + the running adb as sudo is ...
# Since I don't use/need this ability often I don't care if it's a hack like this
# 
flatpak install flathub in.srev.guiscrcpy #activate developer options=> enable usb & wifi debugging
