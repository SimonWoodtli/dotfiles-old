## Installation

**WARNING**: This is work in progress and may be buggy. Use it at your own risk. I suggest you fork this repository
first. And then remove the things you may not want or need.

### Get started

Before you start:
- If you want to get everything working you need to make sure you have a ~/.gitconfig with your username configured
- If you want to use a github.com path (see 1.) you need to make some manual changes to bashconfig file

1. run `cd` now run `mkdir -p Repos/gitlab.com/your_username/ && cd $_`
2. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/xnasero/dotfiles.git && cd $_`
3. run `./setup`

### Additional configurations

1. bin/ contains all the program specific configurations and installations for debian based systems
2. go to bin/install and install what you need. To run specific configurations as for alacritty, simply run the setup file included in the dir bin/alacritty
